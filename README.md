# Wrangling-and-Analysing-Data-Udacity-Project-4

Thia is the fourth project of the udacity data analyst nanodegree program. The dataset contains data downloaded from the twitter archive of @weratesdogs also known as
@dog_rates, a twitter account popularly known for rating people's dogs using funny comments. Like
many real-life data, this downloaded data does not come clean. The goal of the project is to use
python and its libraries in order to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualisations.

This report contains an analysis and a visualisation of the cleaned weratedogs data, including;

1. The most popular breed or most tweeted breed of dogs

2. The average ratings and average favourite counts for the most tweeted breed of dogs.

3. The average ratings and average favourite counts for the different dog stages.

4. Distribution of the different dog stages

5. The relationship between favourite counts and retweet counts
